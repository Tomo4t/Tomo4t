## Hey, I'm **Tomo_4t** ðŸ‘‹

I build things because I love watching ideas turn into something real â€”  
something you can feel, look at, interact with, and remember.

### ðŸŽ§ What I'm Working On
- **The Jewelâ€™s**  
  A weep-style comic about *The Jewel family.*  
  Currently building a **custom bilingual comic reader** with flip + scroll modes.

- **Dumply Roads**  
  A cozy road-building puzzle game â€”  
  where traffic systems feel *alive* instead of scripted.

- **Skys Apart**  
  A quiet, eerie, story-driven metroidvania  
  inspired by *dark children's folklore* rather than horror jumps.

- **Minecraft Datapacks**  
  From full gameplay systems to small mechanical reworks â€”  
  design and elegance matter more than size.

### ðŸŒ¿ How I Approach Creation
I don't try to make things *perfect.*  
I try to make them **click.**

```
If it's empty â†’ I add.
If it's heavy â†’ I simplify.
If it's alive â†’ I step back.
```

Creation feels better when itâ€™s allowed to breathe.
