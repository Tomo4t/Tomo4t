## Hey, I'm **Tomo_4t** 👋

I build things because I like making my ideas come to life

Allah will raise those who believe among you and those who were given knowledge, by many degrees. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do"

(Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:11)

### How I Think
I don’t chase “perfect.”  
I care about whether it **feels right**.
If it’s empty, I add.  
If it’s heavy, I simplify.  
If it’s alive, I let it breathe.
